What is the Difference between UI and UX?

User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most confused and misused terms in our field. 
A UI without UX is like a painter slapping paint onto canvas without thought; while UX without UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper mache on it. 
A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential for the productâ€™s success.

- UI => CSS stylings only => painting colors
- UX => HTML (table, div, ...etc) => skelton
