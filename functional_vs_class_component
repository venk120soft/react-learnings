https://overreacted.io/how-are-function-components-different-from-classes/

state is Mutable(we can change), and props are Immutable(we can't change)

Class components are Mutated or statefull components when ever any change in state, the entire component get's re render with the Mutated(changed) state Value.

Class components has render method and JSX to define the component and it should extend React.Component it has lifecycle methods to handle in differnt stages of an application.

Functional components are stateless components it has hooks to handle different stages of an application. it is immutable
