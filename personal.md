why your parents called me from June 2025 until I call in the november??
even on my birthday?
when you knew that you are pregnant?

are you intentionally ask them not to call me and you gave the promise fo them that I will make him call you??

nu promise chesaava naa bhartha tho miku cal chesyiatha ani?

or valle cal cheyaledhaa??


2nd point
why did you tell your parents about age? what is your intention?


3rd point
until i speak on Nov your parents disnt talk to me
how would you expect me to pay parents trip? though I pay for them
once they are here how do they talk to me??

4th point
if your parents dont have faith in me not sure why they allow you to come with me
why did your parents asked gold to keep in their name?
or asked to keep on your name only?? which means there is no faith in me
then how would ypu expecting me to pay for thier trip?

5th point 
you only remember what you asked for weekend trips
didnt you remember that you said you alsowork? 
ask for that when you start working.


only couple reasons to continue this relation was
engagement
and our physical meetup

main reason is private meetup otherwise there is no intrest in continuing

i'm seeing your behavior and how you are treating me

lazy to do anything , not even looking after my food needs when i go work
prioritizing yourself . i felt that i took care of me far better than what you are doing
i'm not sure how much time more you need to coupup with my schedules

you are taking me granted for everything

ex: tomoto drumstick, mutton bones even your mom also on my presense


Asking me to share you everything.
what is the point in share everything, though you dont understand anything.
though you understand, you dont want to compromize on anything then whats the point??
